# Python SQLite API
# sqlite3 — DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite databases
# SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows
# accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
# Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage.
# It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.
# The sqlite3 module provides a SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249.
# Registering an adapter callable.
# The other possibility is to create a function that converts the type to the string representation and register the function with register_adapter().
